When Posterous was created, it was perfect.

Over time it became bloated, but it's heart was still in the right place.  Then it died.

Preposterous is an attempt to ressurect the heart of Posterous, in about 100 lines of Python.

###How it works###
To start a new blog, send a post via email to preposterouss email address.  Preposterous will read the email, create a new blog and post your initial entry.  When you want to post again, send another email.

Preposterus maintains an index of all bloggers using each server, and generates an index for the posts in each blog as well. Blogs are identified by the email address used to post, so to create additional blogs, just submit a post from a different email address.

Anything that can send an email can publish via Preposterus.

###Useage###
To setup a Preposterous server, start by setting up an email address that the server will listen to (an address you'll be sending posts to), free gmail addresses work great for this.

Next clone this repository and open up the preposterous.py file in your favorite editor.  At the top theres a couple configuration variables you'll need to setup for your site.

Next copy the index.html file into the directory you specified in the configuration as the web root.

Once the script is configured, send a post to the email address you setup above and then run the preposterous.py script. If all goes well it will return silently, and you should have a new directory where you specified the web root to be.  If the script returns an error, or doesn't create a new blog directory, review the Issues list here to see if you're experiencing a known issue.  If not, and if you don't know what else to do, post a new Issue here with details on your setup and how to recreate the error.

If all goes well the next step is to expose your blog files to the web.  The files generated by Preposterous are simple HTML and can be served using any webserver (or even viewed directly in a browser).  Bundling a server with the script is under consideration.

If you just want to *use* Preposterous but don't want to run a server, Im considering setting up a site running Preposterous for public use, but Ill probably wait until the code is a little more mature and see how much interest there is first.
